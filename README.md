## UHS Encounter Trends & Forecasting Project

### Overview
This project analyzes University Health Services (UHS) encounter data to understand usage patterns, detect anomalies, and forecast future encounter trends. The analysis helps predict demand, optimize staffing, and support operational planning for student health services.

---

### Objectives
- Analyze monthly and weekday encounter patterns  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Forecast future encounter volumes  
- Detect anomalies in encounter behavior  
- Cluster months based on encounter volume levels  

---

### Methods Used
- Time-series analysis  
- Forecasting  
- Clustering  
- Anomaly detection  
- Trend & seasonal pattern analysis  
- Data visualization  

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Key Results

#### Monthly Trends
- Peak encounters during February–April  
- Highest volume in April (~5400 encounters)  
- Significant summer drop during June–July  
- Return to higher volume in September  

#### Weekly Patterns
- Highest activity Monday–Wednesday  
- Very low activity on weekends  

#### Forecasting
- Forecast predicts stable encounter levels for October–December  
- Seasonal patterns follow the academic calendar  

#### Anomaly Detection
- Spikes observed in February–April  
- Likely linked to seasonal illness or campus health events  

#### Clustering
| Volume Level | Months | Pattern |

| High | February–April | Peak demand |
| Medium | March, May, September | Active campus periods |
| Low | June–August | Summer / break period |
